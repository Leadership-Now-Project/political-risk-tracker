      "description": "DOJ indicted journalist Don Lemon and 8 co-defendants on charges of conspiracy against religious freedom and interfering with the exercise of religious freedom at a place of worship. The charges stem from Lemon's livestreaming coverage of an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church in St. Paul on January 18, where demonstrators entered after discovering a pastor was an ICE official. Lemon was arrested by FBI/HSI in Beverly Hills at midnight, released on own recognizance, and pleaded not guilty. Career prosecutors reportedly refused to participate in the case.",
